# Real Time Chat App

This is a Real Time Chat App. Connected users can share live messages with each other. The backend acts to emit user chats to all connected users. There is no chat log to keep the environment neat and clean. User authentication is not implemented to encourage user engagement. Instead, chats are posted per IP Address with a Date-Time Stamp based on your local machine.

## Areas for Improvement

- Implement user authentication
- Add persistent storage to retrieve chat history

## Scalability

This app can be scaled using the code to create private chat rooms per user, with or without chat history.
